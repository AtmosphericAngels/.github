## Welcome 👋

The AtmosphericAngels organisation hosts a collection of code created as part of the work of AG Engel at the Institute for Atmosphere and Environment (IAU) at the Goethe University in Frankfurt. 

For documentation related to organisational tasks in the group, 
refer to the [AG-Orga](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/AG-Orga) repository. 

Guides to access and use most of our software and instrumentation can be found 
in [how-to-docs](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/how-to-docs)

If you're (relatively) new to programming, it'll be worth having a look at our useful 
[get-started](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/get_started) guide. 

For useful code snippets and functions, you will want to check out 
our handy [toolpac](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/toolpac) - if 
you're only just getting started, have a look at
the [toolpac tutorial](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/get_started/blob/master/How_to_toolpac.md).
Should you want to contribute to the toolpac yourself, please refer to the 
[toolpac Wiki](https://github.com/AtmosphericAngels/toolpac/wiki) page for general guidelines to follow.
